# How can experimental writing help deconstruct the celebrated narratives of colonialism that define Portuguese national identity?

## Introduction

In Portugal, the violence of colonisation is not fully acknowledged but is instead highly glorified. Every child undergoes a socialisation process that fosters a strong national identity aligned with the colonial period, called *"Descobrimentos"* (meaning "Discoveries"). This is executed through a selective apparatus for the production and distribution of knowledge in schools, monuments, public spaces, language, and other tools, as well as at home. The violence is always omitted, minimised, or relativised, shapeshifting into to the spread of christian faith, comercial trade towards globalisation, a glorification of "heroic" navigation deeds, or the “civilisation” of other cultures. 

One of the mechanisms is the mandatory school reading of [[Os Lusíadas]]. This very famous book is an epic poem written by [[Camões]] in the 16th century, that recounts an fictive version of the first journey to India by sea. It contains 10 chapters, consisting of 8816 ten-syllable verses (mostly heroic deca-syllables: stressed on the 6th and 10th syllables) and 1102 eight-line stanzas (octaves). The rhymes used are alternating and paired. 

I intend to investigate how I can rewrite [[Os Lusíadas]], using experimental writing together with texts, books, media, scripts, and other artifacts within Lusophony. In this text, I create a solid understanding of why I am doing this, its context, meaning, relevance to this day, resources and methodologies of work. This is an unstable research, in constant change through time and collaboration.

Firstly, I will explain how colonial violence has been washed for the last decades and in which ways colonialism is still celebrated in today's Portuguese society, including the mandatory reading of  [[Os Lusíadas]] working as a beacon for national identity. Later I will dive into its mythification through epic poems and present the methodologies I am using for the rewriting of the original book.
##  Celebrated narratives

Although the traffic of enslaved peoples was practiced in the African continent prior to Portuguese arrival, Portugal significantly boosted the practice through the foundation of the Atlantic enslaved trade, transforming people into one of the most lucrative forms of international commodity at the time, and setting a racial order until today. Capturing was first conducted through direct raids on the the African coast, and later through organised stations whose supply was either a product of war prisoners, unjust judicial trials (analogous to contemporary US prison systems) or earlier social status.[^aurora] In the following centuries, the practice was replicated by the English, French, Dutch, Danish or Swedish, becoming "the largest forced human migration in history" affecting an estimated "10 to 15 million men, women and children".

Today throughout the whole country and culture you can find traces of celebration of the colonial period, without looking very far. This goes from monuments, statues, objects, museums street names and festivals, to its presence in music, what is or is not considered language, in education, or even simple interactions with others.
### Monuments, streets and festivals

Raised in the south of Portugal, Algarve, I was always confronted with the economic discrepancies between retired northern europeans and the locals. Whole cities and regions, such as Vilamoura, Vale de Lobo, Quinta do Lago, were and are completely catered to this social class of immigrants (which we call *estrangeiros* - foreigners, rather than immigrants), with lavish golf resorts, beach hotels, empty holiday mansions and whatnot, while, the basic needs of the local population remain chronically under-resourced — water, public transport, healthcare, education, ... Beaches, dunes and their biodiversity have also been destroyed for the sake of touristic profit (e.g. the beaches and dunes of Quarteira). 

Algarve is the home for the city of [[Lagos]] - the birth place of the Portuguese colonial period. Yet I have never in those 17 years seen or heard anything regarding this. Clearly there was an intentional effort and money put into making higher social classes in the region more comfortable in recent years, yet none into accommodating a much older social class of immigration driven from the Portuguese former colonies. In fact, the opposite has been done.

In 2016, the city opened the [[Núcleo Museológico Rota da Escravatura]], a museum which they call "Slave" market. This is the first and only museum about slavery in the whole country. While visiting, you discover that during excavations in 2009 for a parking lot, they found around 155  bodies from enslaved people that had been dropped in a rubbish dump[^found-bodies]. To enter the museum, you must first pass by a plaza named Infante Dom Henrique (the perpetuator of the first navigations) with his statue in the middle, and if you walk a few meters further down, you find some more symbols, such as Vasco da Gama and [[Camões]]. If you continue towards the south after visiting the museum, you find a statue of Gil Eanes, who "first" passed through Western Sahara, where the first Africans were kidnapped and subsequently shipped to Portugal[^portuguese-slave-trade-page]. The main street of the city is called *Avenida dos "Descobrimentos"*. Every 2 years the city holds a festival[^lagos-festival] cosplaying the colonial epoch and congratulating the perpetuators of the colonial period who were born in the city, for their "great adventure", "challenging" the unknown and "transforming" the ocean into a "bridge" between two continents. The whole use of language coming from the city's council[^escravizados-palavra], the assertion of pride in the city, such as claiming *"(...) desvendaram os primeiros segredos dos oceanos (...)"* [^lagos-brochura]- uncovered the first secrets of the ocean -, the localisation and connection between monuments, obsession with glorifying and even cosplaying this period, digging bodies of enslaved people, showcasing them in the museum[^slave-market-essay] and building a mini-golf court on the burial site[^lagos-minigolf], while at the same time intentionally omitting any references to the kidnapping, enslavement, and murder of displaced peoples as well as violence perpetuated in the former colonies[^atlantica-colonial-pain] leaves the slavery museum looking like a very clear performance of a fake reconciliation with the past. Moreover, when referring to the museum, the president of the municipality at the time referred to it as a driver for tourism[^lagos-museum-tourism-erasure]. 

In respect to memorial sites, Lisbon does not fall much further. In 2017, the association DJES (Association of Afrodescendents) proposed the city's council, as part of the participatory budget contest, to build a memorial site paying homage to the victims of the Atlantic enslaved trade. The municipality agreed to the project, and DJES made an open-call for 5 invited artists to foresee this project. The idea of Kiluanji Kia Henda - a plantation of sugar cane - was chosen to be implemented, but after 8 years is yet to become a reality, as the city's council keeps creating various obstacles towards execution, including inexplicable waiting times between replies, changing previously set locations, producing fake images in relation to the artist's original idea, etc. A similar case, happened with Batoto Yetu Portugal, who created 20 signs and a bust honouring African presence in Lisbon. The artworks were fully completed in 2020, there was a budget for setting them up in the city funded by the association itself, yet the process remained stale until 2024[^batoto]. One could argue in defense for the economic condition of the country (and consequential waiting times), however, in 2023, the government, the city of Loures and Lisbon, spent together 75 million euros[^papa] to receive the pope, which then is already deemed acceptable due to the returns on tourism.

Throughout the city you can find numerous instruments glorifying the colonial period, such as *Padrão dos "Descobrimentos"* [^padrao-descobrimentos](that includes a statue of [[Camões]] writing [[Os Lusíadas]], see [[grounds#^fig-padrao]]), countless caravels and compasses drawn in the sidewalks (see [[grounds#^fig-rosa-dos-ventos]], [[grounds#^fig-rosa-dos-ventos-lagos]], [[grounds#^fig-caravel-lisboa]]), statues of the many colonial participants (such as the statue of Father António Vieira[^vieira] surround by what seems to be indigenous children from the Americas, erected in 2017 - [[grounds#^fig-padre]]), shopping malls designed as caravels or allusive to the colonial period (e.g. Vasco da Gama, Colombo), Villa of the Count of Monte Cristo in Sintra[^sintra-casa], as well as other directly connected infrastructure, like *Rua do Poço dos Negros*, that appears to be one more pit for the dead bodies of the enslaved[^contested-legacies].

The same goes for Porto, where you can find active (re)erected ruins of the colonial period [^noticia-publico] without any affirmations surrounding its inherent violence. The city not only has an interactive museum catered to children - the World of Discoveries[^world-discoveries] -, but also held the "Portuguese Colonial Exhibition" in 1934, similarly to other European countries.

### Exhibitionist governments

The exhibition took place in *Palácio de Cristal*, a garden where 1.3 million visitors could go by foot, train or cable car, visit a theatre, a zoo, a tea house, several monuments, as well as inhabitants from the former colonies living on display for the duration of the event - to simulate their "real" habitat. On the entrance of the exhibition stood a temporary statue - the Portuguese Monument to Colonial Effort -, which was later replicated in stone, dismantled in 1943, and re-erected in 1984 under the city's council orders. The statue has been contested through grafitti and art exhibitions (e.g. [[Unearthing memories]] and [[grounds#^fig-fascists-out]]), while it has also been celebrated by the extreme right-wing party "Ergue-te".[^colonial-exhibitions]

In Lisbon, a similar exhibition was held in 1940 - the Portuguese World Exhibition -, attended by 3 million visitors, that left behind the famous touristic attraction - *Padrão dos "Descobrimentos"* - mentioned earlier. Both exhibitions, as Alves, B. notes (together with Peralta, E. and Vicente, F.), contributed to a stereotyped view of the colonised as those who lack civilisation and order, by presenting them as "primitive" in "their natural habitats". Vicente goes further to say that these spaces served as a means to eroticise the empire, making a parallel between femininity and becoming colonised, in contrast with the imperial European masculinity that would dominate it.[^vicente] 

Another more subtle example, was Expo 98, that commemorated 500 years since Vasco da Gama arrived to India. Dressing the ocean as the main theme - "The Oceans, a Heritage for the Future" - and associating it with greenwashed sustainability and environmental protection, the expo attempted to rearrange Portuguese earlier national identity (centred around imperialism and othering) to meet the symbolic demands of neoliberal agendas defined by the new European democracies. Commodifying its violent past into "an exchange value in the cultural and tourist consumption market", as seen above with the city of Lagos. As well as showcasing an open, expansionist and enterprising attitude to secure foreign investment.[^expo98]

All these exhibitions helped at sanitising colonialism, establishing a mystical national identity originating from "the Portuguese as a marine folk, descendant of the 'heroic discoverers of the world', held by fate to the higher call of helping others 'reach civilisation'", “uninterruptedly transmitting the sacred blood” of their heroes, while perpetuating collective epic narratives. [^elsa-epic] Lusotropicalism, as an ideological tool, further helped at legitimising the myth, stating that Portuguese colonialism was (in comparison to other coloniser nations) softer, peaceful, gentle, hybrid, miscegenated, multicultural, and somehow Creole,[^elsa-creole] completely omitting all the sexual violence. 

Gilberto Freyre, the developer of this theory, was invited by the Portuguese government in the 1950s, to visit and analyse the former colonies. His "independent" views on the benign nature of our colonialism became the official doctrine of the dictatorial regime in the 1960s, in order to appease the criticism from other European nations whose colonial regimes had collapsed. Disseminated through textbooks, media, and official documents, the ideas became ingrained in Portuguese culture[^gilberto] and can still be seen in the words of our current President - Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa (whose father, interestingly enough, used to be a Governor-General of Mozambique from 1968 until 1970[^rebelo] ). 
### Language and things

In 2016, in a newspaper, our President claims we, as a nation, have an exceptional ability to learn and include others, creating bridges between cultures, civilisations and continents.
In 2017, in a visit to Senegal, he recognises slavery's injustice and consequentially affirms that our country abolished it in 1761 (a lie pushed as anti-racist discourse in both school and day-to-day conversations[^lie] ). This generated protests that called for the President to apologise for slavery in the name of the country, which he still has not. In 2019, in the Day of Portugal (the day that commemorates the death of [[Camões]]), Marcelo again insists that we are a nation at ease with its past, actively constructing the present and arming the future, encompassed by many 'Portugals' that extend beyond its geographic boundaries. In 2018, in Boston, he states that the USA is a big country, but that Portugal is even bigger, that in fact we have the biggest country in the world. This rhetoric could be comparable to 1934's propaganda: [[grounds#^figpequeno]].[^marcelo]

In the same year in the WebSummit, Lisbon's mayor - Fernando Medina - offered an astrolabe to the founder of the conference, pointing out that "Lisbon was the capital of the world five centuries ago, (...) From Lisbon departed a great adventure that connected the human race. . . . Today it is you, the engineers, the entrepreneurs, the creators, the innovators, the start-ups, all the companies".[^websummit] 

The list goes on. Like I had mentioned before, you don't have to look far; even the stamps I got at the post office were illustrated accordingly - [[grounds#^fig-stamps]]. The rhetoric bleeds out in dialogues explicitly or implicitly. Paradoxically, we have included a great amount of words from former colonies' languages in our quotidian. For example, the widely used *bué* and *bazar* (from Kimbundu language *mbuwe* and *kubaza*, respectively). Yet not only are these not considered languages by the Portuguese standard (e.g. Badiu), but when it comes to officially including the terms in formal settings, they become slang. As if the miscegenation between languages is only desirable when the objective is to re-iterate our inclusive nature for means of later commodification.

### **[[Os Lusíadas]]** and education

Which leads me to what I want to re-write - [[Os Lusíadas]]. This is THE book - unmatched, unrivaled, irreplaceable, incomparable, transcendent, the pinnacle of poetry in the eyes of Portuguese society. In fact, second to this would only be [[A Mensagem]], its homage whose objective was to awake Portugal's "greatness". Published in 1934, the poet Fernando Pessoa sought to rebuild national identity through myth and memory. He revisits Portugal’s past prophetically, contrasting it with the 20th century's decline. And like [[Camões]], he glorifies national "heroes", urging for a cultural revival into what was called the "Fifth Empire".[^empire]

In school, it's mandatory to "analyse" both [[Os Lusíadas]] and [[A Mensagem]]. Yet the efforts to reflect upon the contemporary and huge underlying issue behind these two texts are minimal if even existent. In 8th grade History books while there is a slight connection between the "discoveries" and violence (found predominantly as side notes), there is no mention of our founding contribution to the Atlantic enslaved trade, for how long and how it occurred, how many people were displaced or died at sea, or its overall impact in the present day. Mostly you learn about the chronology of occupation and economics, that converge in "Portugal was the main economic European power in the second half of XVI".[^historia] Putting that aside, once we move into 9th grade Portuguese, [[Os Lusíadas]]  is taught under the framework of narrative text, epic poetry, pronouns, rhymes, metaphors, perifrasis, etc., i.e. "objectively", without any mention to colonisation.[^portugues] The connection between the two is not made and no thoughts are put into understanding what is actually being said. 

For example, close to the end of chapter I (*canto* I), the Portuguese arrive to Mozambique's islands and come across, what he describes as, the moors, who themselves (through the imagination of [[Camões]]) describe the locals as "*sem Lei e sem Razão*" (without Law or Reason). This immediately reveals and justifies the 'civilising' mission. Then the moors (guided by Bachus, who is trying to prevent the Portuguese "inevitable faith" of arriving to India) attack us, even though we had been "very generous". We of course win the battle and in the last stanzas turn out to be the victim of this unprovoked violence - a projection of the opressor into the oppressed.[^memorias1]

> No mar tanta tormenta e tanto dano, 
> Tantas vezes a morte apercebida! 
> Na terra tanta guerra, tanto engano, 
> Tanta necessidade avorrecida! 
> Onde pode acolher-se um fraco humano, 
> Onde terá segura a curta vida, 
> Que não se arme e se indigne o Céu sereno 
> Contra um bicho da terra tão pequeno?[^lusiadas]

> By sea what treach'rous calms, what rushing storms,  
> And death attendant in a thousand forms!  
> By land what strife, what plots of secret guile,  
> How many a wound from many a treach'rous smile!  
> Oh where shall man escape his num'rous foes,  
> And rest his weary head in safe repose![^lusiads]

## Myths and epics

The traces of colonialism in other European countries, as well as current neocolonialist policies, are numerous. For example the 2024's unrest in New Caledonia, or Macron's recent statements regarding Burkina Faso.[^caledonia] Yet, they feel different to contemporary Portuguese efforts. For an empire who claims to have been so powerful, becoming one of EU's poorest countries certainly makes it look more like a myth. 

My father's childhood was marked by poverty and watching dead bodies come back from the colonial war during Salazar's dictatorship. My mother's by an absent father, smuggled to Paris to work as a construction worker (like many), avoiding military duties. The 14 years of war drained the country by 1974 consuming around 40% of the national budget.[^25abril] But even before that, Portugal was a declining empire, and [[Os Lusíadas]] personifies this through the ominous figure of *Velho do Restelo*, emerging as a critic of the ambition and greed that drove the colonial expansion. Indeed, mere years after the book was published, the king dies in Alcácer-Quibir, plunging the country into Spanish ruling and intensifying Portuguese-Dutch conflicts (due to the 80-years war with Spain). The Dutch disrupted the Portuguese colonial network, capturing Indonesian territories, Mallaca, São Tomé, the north of Brazil, Luanda, etc. 

After restoring independence, and with its empire shrunk to the Netherlands, Portugal turned to Brazil's gold reserves. In 1750 Portugal's output per capital was considerably higher than those of France or Spain, yet just a century later, it became Western Europe’s poorest country. Brazilian gold influx, crucial to enrich the country's elites, caused a 30% real exchange rate appreciation, making labour and capital shift to luxury goods and services, consequently collapsing domestic industries (e.g. textiles) and leaving the country de-industrialised, "reduced to a poor, quasi-dependent primary product exporter in Britain’s orbit" - a phenomenon known as Dutch disease.[^gold] Fast-forwarding without the proper detail and nuance, Napoleonic wars led the king to flee to Brazil, and later claim its independence. The dissolution of the former colony left Portugal economically peripheral, with no industry, faced by a crippling British ultimatum and consequent civil war. This paved the way to the first republic, which equally unstable, culminated in Salazar's dictatorship from 1930 till 1974. 

During that period, Portugal was willing to go beyond economic exchange value - it gripped on to the territories even when they weren't profitable. It saw them as a symbol of its "heroic" past, retaining them "no matter how small or poor", "fearing that any reduction would weaken Portugal's claim to be a world 'civilizing' power"[^cia]. Following "decolonization"[^deco], a dominant memory emerged as an adapted colonial myth legitimising the transition as a mutual, fraternal liberation retaining strong cultural bonds. It depicted Portugal as a soft coloniser, multiracial and naturally capable of managing future post-colonial relations, as mentioned earlier through the words of our current President. This perspective not only guided Portuguese foreign policy to fit an identity that could prove advantageous when integrating EEC/EU,[^eec] but also completely undermined the liberation movements inspired by [[Amílcar Cabral]]’s revolutionary ideas, that restored Portugal's democracy. The Armed Forces Movement that staged the coup d’état on April 25, 1974, was born in Bissau in August 1973 and "led by war-fatigued junior officers who admired Cabral". His party, the PAIGC was also in contact with Mozambique’s FRELIMO and Angola's MPLA. 

The empire has been in free fall since the epic poem was written. The country still lives an inferiority complex, trying to convince itself out of its subaltern position in Europe. Lacking an identity other than coloniality; mythifying oneself through the remnants of this "glorious" empire, to compensate for a longing to be what it "once was"; and avoiding the "painful necessity of confronting" its smallness. You see it in Salazar's words: ‘this union with the overseas territories gives us an optimism and sense of greatness that are indispensable in energising us and driving away any feelings of inferiority.’[^salazar] You see it in Marcelo's words above. You see it in Saudosismo - a literary movement whose basis is the feeling of *saudade* (longing for). You see it in [[Os Lusíadas]], where a past fictional journey is still aggressively shouted as a fundamental pillar of Portuguese culture.[^eduardo] 
 
The book could have been a novel, or lyrical poetry, but the author deliberately chose epic poetry, a tool close to that of myth. He himself states it by asking Virgil's Aeneid and Homer's Odyssey to be ceased immediately in the first chapter.[^canto1] According to Hegel's eurocentric perspectives[^hegel2], this kind of poetry is not an expression of personal feelings or individual reflections, it's the manifestation of a national spirit presented through a "heroic" event rooted in a nation’s collective consciousness; integrating a "total view" (divine, natural and human) and balancing individual agency with a divine mandate.[^hegel1] In our case, this was the mission to "expand christian faith" and "civilize the world", consolidated by multiple papal bulls (e.g. _Dum Diversas_, that authorised Portugal to extract resources and subjugate Africans to "perpetual servitude"). The event was the journey to India that was semi-orchestrated by Venus and Bacchus interventions expressed through natural phenomenons, like tempests, battles, allies or favourable currents, i.e. colonial expansion framed as a cosmic battle. However, in Hegel's view, one could say that [[Os Lusíadas]] is not actually a pure epic for its self-conscious nationalism and didactic interventions, but instead, as Lourenço puts it - a coherent war machine[^eduardo2] - geared towards inspiring a falling empire.

In the quest to justify land and body theft, filiation becomes crucial and takes place through Christianity's mechanisms as a temporarily linear and universalising spirit. In other words, anything that was opaque to these believes, anything that was not affiliated with them (not from the same root), the other, had to be either assimilated or annihilated, as it posed a threat to it's universal truth.[^gliss] A threat analogous to how Palestine has been framed by Israel - an opaque obstacle to a mythic filiation rooted in biblical narratives. 

The concept of filiation is visible, for example, in stanza 53 of *Canto I*: 

> "Somos (um dos das Ilhas lhe tornou) 
> Estrangeiros na terra, Lei e nação; 
> Que os próprios são aqueles que criou 
> A Natura, sem Lei e sem Razão. 
> Nós temos a Lei certa que ensinou 
> O claro descendente de Abraão,
> (...)"[^lusiadas]

> "Rude are the natives here," the Moor replied;  
> Dark are their minds, and brute-desire their guide:  
> But we, of alien blood, and strangers here,  
> Nor hold their customs nor their laws revere.  
> From Abram's race our holy prophet sprung,
> (...)"[^lusiads]

Partly broken by the king's death in 1578 without succession, it started a century-long pursuit of legitimisation through the myth-making of the epic poem - bypassing bloodlines, and transforming into a lineage of "heroes" held together by inevitable "destiny" and faith. 

Rather than confronting the end of this fictive filiation and recognise it as a violent imposition, "decolonisation", as mentioned before, was refashioned to fit a new national identity. Not a loss of legitimacy but a continuation of Portugal's role, not as an imperial patriarchy, but as a benevolent mediator between Europe and the Global South. It revealed not the collapse of the myth, but its plasticity till today.

## Methodologies

Filiation, like a root, means the absolute exclusion of the other. Unlike a rhizome, where new shoots can emerge and become their own individuals, spread but kept connected through a decentralised network.[^gliss2] In Glissant's Poetics of Relation (the book that has been serving as the foundation for my work), an example of a rhizome would be the formation of creolised societies, and the creole languages themselves. Perpetuated by the Portuguese, the forced displacement of Africans taken from multiple origins, carrying an opaqueness to each other and to the unknown land without their roots, formed complex and often untraceable new identities, languages, cultures through the Relation with the Other (opposite to a singular dominant root embodied by the colonisers).[^gliss3] I would like to embody this idea of rhizome through experimental writing.

Experimental writing is difficult to define. To grasp the term, I have a small library of [references, ideas and techniques](https://gleaming-join-3fc.notion.site/references-ideas-techniques-2afd4af098b242eda61b21e4ab4bf33f) that helps at understanding the many shapes it can take. For example: "cut a page in half and switch sides", "write without the letter A", "blackout text", "cut syllables, sentences, paragraphs or shapes, reorder them", "make footnotes that comment on missing text", etc.[^mariana] Concerning colonialism, [[NourbeSe Philip]]'s [[Zong!]] would perhaps be one the best references. In her work, she erases parts of the legal documents of Gregson v. Gilbert, a case about 150 Africans who were thrown overboard by the captain of a enslaved ship (see [[grounds#^fig-zong]]).  In the Portuguese context, within the 1960's experimental poetry movement ([PO.EX](https://po-ex.net/)), *Barros*'s *Gritos de Angústia*, transforms the words "*escravos*" ("slaves") and "cravos" (carnations - the symbol of the 1974's revolution) back and fourth (see [[grounds#^fig-barros]]). In the Netherlands, Kaersenhout uses old history books as a medium for cut-outs, collages and texts (see [[grounds#^fig-patricia]]).

When analysing Zong! through Glissant's lens, we can see that the scattering of its words and phrases (and the intentional spacing they each have to breath), refuses a hierarchical structure. Each fragment has its roots but as whole, they become unpredictable and open-ended. The work is opaque as the text does not form a linear narrative, nor structures cohesive sentences whose meaning can be objectively extracted, or reduced in its complexity - it rejects logic in favor of an emotional resonance. 

In helm of epic poems, another example would be St Lucian Derek Walcott's [[Omeros]] that "draws on the language, imagery, and themes of Homer, as well as Virgil’s _Aeneid_", to describe his struggled with mixed identity. This epic does not follow a linear path and has no main protagonist, as the narrative is jumps both in time and between characters and his own voice.[^omero]

### Rewriting [[Os Lusíadas]]

My point in rewriting the epic poem is not to criticise [[Camões]]. But rather to re-instrumentalize the symbolism and grandiosity that has been positioned upon his book from the last centuries until now, to express the violent nature of our past. And while there is numerous work tackling this very urgent concern, 

- from academic texts (e.g. from [[Elsa Peralta]], [[Ana Balona de Oliveira]], [[Aurora Almada e Santos]], [[Joacine Katar Moreira]]), 
- to books (e.g. [[Memórias da plantação]], [[Volta para tua terra]], [[Toward final victory!]]), 
- to music (e.g. [[Dino d' Santiago]], [[Azagaia]], [[Povo pequenino - Fado Bicha]]), 
- to films (by [[Welket Bungué]], [[A Guerra]], [[Quilombo]], [[Sambizanga]]), 
- to performances (e.g. by [[Panaibra Gabriel Canda]], [[Opera to a Black Venus]], [[De-Re-Memorization of Portuguese Colonialism and Dictatorship]]), 
- to visual art (e.g. by [[Sandim Mendes]], [[Mónica de Miranda]], [[Irineu Destourelles]], [[The singularity of Tchiloli - René Tavares]], [[(Re)descobertas - Olavo Amado]]), 
- to exhibitions (e.g. [[Unearthing memories]],  [[Problemas do Primitivismo – a partir de Portugal]]) 
- and other artifacts or spaces (e.g. [[Jornal O negro]], Hangar, Bazofo & Dentu Zona), 

I am convinced that I can make a meaningful contribution by rewriting this treasured and deeply cherished book through the words, sentences and paragraphs of these creators. More specifically, orchestrating cut-outs of the epic poem together with cut-outs from texts of lusophonic de-colonial authors (as well as other works that I might find crucial, like Poetics of Relation). The texts can vary and derive from interviews, to academic papers, songs, poetry, books, theatre pieces, performances, visual art, conversations, or others, all in equal grounds. To make use of a certain text, its engaged with theoretically, the words are not just removed and decontextualised, since the point is not to assimilate or annihilate them, but to elevate them. Whole sentences are prioritised over words, in order to limit the amount of freedom I have with the emerging combination of texts. The more of the cut-out text remains, the more opacity is preserved, the more I facilitate the words to come together rather than write.
#### Maintaining structure 

The immediate question that arises is if it makes sense to keep the same structure as the epic poem. Although, [[Os Lusíadas]] is not completely linear (as in it jumps back and fourth time periods), it is chronological. Beyond that, it has delineated chapters, 1102 rigid stanzas and decasyllabic verses. Replicating this structure could mean to be rooted in the original. And while that is true, I can still see advantages that lead me into taking that decision. Other than the content-wise divine elements and the nationalist rhetoric that praises the Portuguese, the structure of the epic poem is what makes it so mystical - the making of such a work is perceived as extremely complex and genius. Choosing not to do so could mean losing an opportunity to overshadow its ingenuity - relevant when the goal is to dismantle it and actually talk about the underlying violence. Thus, it makes sense to create 1102 ABABABCC stanzas with decasyllabic verses, but in a non-linear narrative. Consequentially, if the structure is followed rigidly, suddenly breaking it in certain verses can amplify its power.

On that note, decasyllables are counted as poetic syllables, rather than gramatical. For instance, *te-le-vi-são* (te-le-vi-sion) has 4 grammatical syllables, but 3 poetic syllables *tle-vi-são* (tle-vi-sion) when recited in Portuguese. This then means that when well-recited, keeping its rhythm, one is forced to read with a certain regional accent.   
#### Collaboration

A crucial point for the work is how to incorporate multiple voices while at the same time operating from a Portuguese perspective and how to ensure that multiplicity leads the reimagining, instead of a single authoritative voice. It seems that collaboration is paramount in achieving this. As of now I have been in conversation with [[Sandim Mendes]], [[Tavares Cebola]] and [[Mariana Aboim]], who have generously helped me navigate the project and its doubts. Ideally, the objective would be to have co-authors write certain stanzas of the book with their own words. However, what exactly to request of them (in terms of structure) or how to navigate between intentional fragmentation and accidental incoherence, is still uncertain to me and highly depends on the availability of funding to pay for their work.
#### Translation

This leads me to the next question of if and how to include other languages - if it makes sense to, for instance, use cut-outs written in Badiu, Forro, Kikongo, Kimbundu, etc, when I don't speak them. While incorporating these could prove useful at undermining the Portuguese language as a colonial tool, preserving opacity, refusing uniformity or a passive consumption of text, as well as fully capturing experiences that Portuguese can't, I believe it should only be done in collaboration to prevent an extractive linguistic tourism.

In regards to using works written in English (or other languages I feel more comfortable with), and translating them to Portuguese. I have decided to avoid it for a few reasons: translating flattens nuance; my role as a writer over orchestrator gains importance; there is more than enough lusophonic work worthy of attention. Yet, for works that I find incredibly essential to incorporate (e.g. Poetics of Relation), I intend on resorting to trustworthy translations.
#### Typographies and Topographies

I see the outcome of the rewriting not just as a book, but as a library of resources that don't currently belong to the mainstream bookshelves, or to the Portuguese literary canon. I think that the idea of making a new epic poem to characterise Portuguese society can drive enough curiosity in the public, and thus be able to achieve its role as gateway to other artifacts. For this reason, for a question of ethicality, and from an organisational standpoint while working, its imperative that the cut-outs used are clearly referenced. I have defined a specific font size and typography to each source (that may later become a design principle for the book), in order to map them (see [[grounds#^fig-sources]]).

![[WhatsApp Image 2025-05-22 at 15.16.23.jpeg]]
**Fig. 12** - Photos of used sources in different font sizes and typographies ^fig-sources

Each source has a bucket and a plastic bag for storage of cut-outs. What I choose or not to cut-out from a text is initially based on intuition and later on, as it becomes more complicated, on what can be puzzled into the existing stanza to maintain a decasyllabic-8-versed stanza, and obviously the message I want to convey within the possibilities (see [[grounds#^fig-org]]).

**Fig. 13, 14** - Photos of used sources organised ^fig-org

On the parallelism with [[Os Lusíadas]], I am still unsure on how procede in terms of chapters, or if and how to relate each chapter (called *canto*) to which texts I am sourcing. As of now, I have been dissecting what each stanza means and which relations I can find, but also just cutting from the first chapter and see what it can organically bring (see [[grounds#^fig-diss]]).

#### Navigating chaos

Due to the big amount of sources, I have decided to use the software [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) hosted online in this platform. Each page under the artifacts folder, shall have its bibliographic reference, notes and a collection of tags (e.g. "mozambique", "performance", "fiction"), which allows for connections to later be found between them. Instead of hierarchically, I can visualise, navigate and search these sources through a graph view (see [[grounds#^fig-graph]]).

## End notes

 [[Os Lusíadas]] is a ruin of the past that has served and continuous to serve as a means to create a violent world. In its rewriting there is the possibility to betray its legacy, to reinvent it and its role in Portuguese culture, to leave behind a different narrative for the future[^worlding] that can work as tool to return "colonial pain and trauma to its thinkers".[^joacine] I see the project as an open incubator - a library - where new relations could be crafted from, a fertile ruin.

[^lie]: This is so easily debunkable, that it becomes laughable. In a quick search to Wikipedia, it states: "In 1761, the Marquis of Pombal banned the importation of African slaves to Portugal and Portuguese India; this however was not intended as an anti-slavery measure, but to ensure the slaves went to Brazil instead. Portugal abolished its involvement in the Atlantic slave trade in 1836, primarily due to Brazil becoming independent and British diplomatic pressure. Finally, in 1869, slavery was abolished for good in the Portuguese Empire". However, as Cartwright notes "(...) slaves continued to be imported to São Tomé and Principe until prohibition in 1908. Slaves were then replaced by African labourers who had to be repatriated after a certain number of years, but their living conditions were little different from those their slave predecessors had suffered.", and this is evident through official government documents like [[Código do trabalho dos indígenas nas colónias portuguesas de África]], and interviews conducted in [[Forced labour by those who lived through it]].
