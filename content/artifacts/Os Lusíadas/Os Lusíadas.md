bib: Camões, Luís. Os Lusíadas, 4th ed. Preface by Álvaro Júlio da Costa Pimpão, Presentation by António Pinheiro de Castro. Instituto Camões, Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros. 2000.
---
Written by [[Camões]] (1524-1580). He began writing in 1550 and it was published in 1572.  Sebastian (1554) became king in 1557 and took control of the throne in 1568 (14 years old). When he went to North Africa in 1578, he was 24. Sebastian’s disastrous campaign led to Portugal’s decline and eventual annexation by Spain in 1580 (when Camões died).

**The journey to India was as follows:**
Leaves Lisbon: July 1497
Arrives to Calecute: May 1498
Returns to Lisbon: September 1499

## Canto I 
#### Proposition: 
The poet begins his poem by ==stating what he intends to do== and then indicating the subject of his narrative: ==singing the perpetuators who made the Portuguese empire== possible, the kings who promoted the expansion of faith and empire, and all those who become worthy of admiration for their heroic deeds.
#### Invocation: 
==The poet addresses the Tagides (nymphs of the Tagus) to ask for inspiration== to execute the work he proposes to accomplish with eloquence.
#### Dedication:
==The poet dedicates his work to King Sebastian.== Making this dedication accentuates the nationalism embedded in the work, yet it also reflects the status of the artist who is economically dependent on a patron, a protector.
Camões saw King Sebastian as the last hope for Portugal’s empire, while at the same time, expressing deep anxieties about its decline. He was loyal to the monarchy but aware of the realities of the time.

**Why dedicate _Os Lusíadas_ to King Sebastian?**

Camões likely dedicated his work to King Sebastian for patronage, seeking royal favours and financial support after years of difficulties. He also held some hope that the young king would restore Portugal's glory, and viewed him as a potential saviour of the Portuguese empire. Thus, _Os Lusíadas_ served as a call to action, urging the king to govern wisely and avoid the pitfalls of corruption and greed observed in past governments.

**Why was the Portuguese empire declining?**

Portugal's empire was big for the country's size, stretching from Brasil to Africa and Asia, exacerbated by corruption and poor leadership, it relied a lot on colonial wealth rather than internal production. External threats from rivals like Spain, the Ottomans, and especially the Dutch, further challenged its dominance. Internally, Camões criticized the ruling class's moral decline, a corruption he personally experienced through imprisonment in Goa. King Sebastian's ill-fated North African crusade ultimately sealed the empire's tragic decline.

- **Overextension and economic strain** – Portugal’s empire was vast, stretching from Brasil to Africa and Asia, but maintaining it was costly. Corruption, poor leadership, and the reliance on colonial wealth rather than internal production weakened the economy.

- **Threats from rivals** – Spain, the Ottoman Empire, and Dutch traders were challenging Portuguese dominance in different regions. The Dutch, in particular, were beginning to disrupt Portuguese control in the Indian Ocean.

- **Internal corruption and complacency** – Camões criticises the greed and moral decline of Portugal’s ruling class, suggesting that their corruption would lead to the empire’s downfall.

- **King Sebastian’s plans** – By the time Camões published _Os Lusíadas_, Sebastian was already obsessed with launching a crusade in North Africa. This ambition would ultimately lead to Portugal’s downfall at the Battle of Alcácer Quibir in 1578, where the king and much of the Portuguese nobility were killed.

Camões himself **experienced** the effects of this corruption. While serving in the empire, he **was imprisoned in Goa** (possibly for debts or conflicts with corrupt officials). His harsh experiences in the colonies gave him insight into how greed and poor leadership were weakening the empire.
