Mariana is a Portuguese artist based in Rotterdam, who explores how the "endurance of white cisheteropatriarchy manifests itself on the body".

**Meeting on 19/03/2025** (~45min)
We talked mostly about the need for collaboration in the project, what my role is as an orchestrator and how I can effectively execute it: what to ask from others exactly? what degree of chaos I want to have? if there is profit, where does it go to? We also discussed the balance between appropriation and appreciation - ethical usage - of the sources for rewriting, how much I am using, how I am using? We reached the conclusion that I should contact each source as much as possible, and she referenced a book as a guide for ethical sourcing (whose name i have forgotten in the meantime, and need to re-ask), but it talked about the case of Rana Hamadeh and Zong! (see [[Zong!#^zong-and-rana]]). We also talked about translation, how to approach languages that are not in Portuguese, to which matter I still find confusion. I also invited Mariana to participate in the project and asked her if I could use her writings, to which she said yes. Mariana urged me to start testing prototypes immediately. ^meeting-1
