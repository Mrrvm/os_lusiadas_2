"Dr Joacine Katar Moreira describes herself as an accidental politician. She is a dual national of Guinea-Bissau and Portugal. In 2019, she was the first racialized woman to head a party list in a Portuguese legislative election, and she was elected to the Portuguese Parliament. Drawing from her background in history, heritage management, development studies, and african studies, she was the first Member of Parliament to openly talk about the restitution of cultural objects from Portugal to territories it once colonized in Africa (Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea- Bissau, Mozambique, and St Tomé and Príncipe)" - [[Inventorying is reckoning]]
